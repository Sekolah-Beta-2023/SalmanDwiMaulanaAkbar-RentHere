# RentHere

RentHere is an easy-to-use website that facilitates vehicle rentals, including cars and motorcycles (for now), in the future there may be more vehicle options and multiple branches. In this website, there are two user roles: admin and user. The admin has full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) capabilities for the following:

- User Management
- Car Management
- Motorcycle Management
- Transaction Management
- Testimonial Management

On the other hand, registered users have the ability to create and edit transactions. However, the ability to delete transactions and proceed to payment is still under development. Visitors who are not logged in can still access certain pages on the RentHere website, such as viewing the list of available vehicles, services offered, testimonial page, contact page, and landing or home page. Access to the details and transaction pages is reserved for logged-in users only.

Don't hesitate any longer, visit the RentHere website and experience the convenience of renting a vehicle.
